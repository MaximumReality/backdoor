Randomness 


1. The "Quantum Litterbox" (Dark Web Style)
A minimalist, high-contrast terminal page that looks like a leaked database.
• The Content: Encrypted "chat logs" between Azul and Mochkil where they discuss their plans for world domination (or just where the good catnip is hidden).
• The Visual: A slow-scrolling wall of green text with redacted bars.
• Interactive Element: A "Decrypt" button that, when held down, reveals secret concept art for your upcoming games or snippets of your novels.
2. The "CCTV: Sector_Zero" Feed
A "Surveillance" hub that looks like a hacked security monitor.
• The Content: A grid of static-filled boxes. One box plays a looped, glitched video of a kitchen (Mochkil's domain), another shows a dark room with a glowing keyboard (Azul's lab).
• The Visual: VHS-style scanlines, "REC" blinking in the corner, and a timestamp from the year 2099.
• Interactive Element: Clicking the "Camera Feeds" switches the audio between white noise and "Mochkil's Snack Attack" theme music.
3. The "Neural Uplink" (Cyberpunk Brain-Scan)
A purely abstract, artistic page that represents the cats' digital consciousness.
• The Content: A floating 3D-style wireframe of a cat's head (using CSS/JS) that rotates as you move your iPhone.
• The Visual: Neon pink and blue geometric shapes that pulse to a heartbeat sound.
• Interactive Element: Tapping different parts of the "brain" triggers popup windows with "Core Memories"—little flashes of text from your children's stories or cyberpunk news.
